# Blender-LOS-Camera-Based-Visibility-Analysis
Python script for Blender that performs line-of-sight (LOS) visibility analysis of a target surface from a predefined camera (approximating the human visual field).The script is intended for spatial, architectural, and archaeological analysis (e.g. visibility of rock art panels in caves), but it can be applied to any 3D environment.
